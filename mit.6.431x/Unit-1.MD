# Probability. Unit 1. Sample Space and Probability

## 1.1.3 Sample space

> Sample space, set of all possible outcomes

- Set of possible outcomes, $\Omega$
    - Mutually exclusive 
    - Collectively exhaustive
    - At right granularity, with relevant features
- Likelihood of outcomes

> Discrete & Finite / Continuous & Infinite

> Experiment, Probabilistic experiment

> an **outcome** is a possible result of an experiment 

Experiment with stages
sequenctial description: Tree


## 1.1.7 Probability Axioms

P(A), read: Probability of set A

> Event: A subset of the sample space, or a set of outcomes 

Individual outcomes of continuous space have all a probability = 0.  
Probability is assigned to events (but not to individuals outcomes)

Axioms

> Non-negativity: $ P(A) \ge 0 $

> Normalization: $ P(\Omega) = 1 $

> (Finite) additivity: $ \text{If } A \cap B = \emptyset \text{, then } P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) $

$ A \cap B = \emptyset$: events (and sets) are "disjoint"

$ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P( A \cap B)$

Consequences:

> $ P(A) \le 1 $   

> $ P(\empty) = 0 $   

> $ P(A) + P(A^c) = 1 $   

> Complement of event

$ A^c $ is the **complement** of event A, such as $ A \cup A^c = \Omega $, and $ A \cap A^c = \empty $

> $ P(A \cup B \cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C)$, if the 3 set are disjoint
