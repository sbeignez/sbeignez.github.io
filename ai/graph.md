# Graph, Data Structures

## 1. Graph

### 1.1 Definition of a Graph

> A __Graph__: a structure composed of Vertices and Edges. $G = (V, E)$.
> * V, set of __Vertices__ (or Nodes)
> * E, set of __Edges__ (link): paired vertices

> __Directed__ graph:

> __Weighted__ graph:

> __Complete__ graph: contains all possible edges

> __Connected__ graph: if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected. This means that there is a path between every pair of vertices.


 
### 1.2 Storing a Graph

Data strutures to store a graph, two common methods:
* adjacency matrix
* adjacency list

### 1.3 Graph Traversal algorithm



## 2. Tree

### 2.1. Definition of tree

> A tree: is a connected, undirected graph with no cycles.

> A __rooted__ tree: is a tree with one vertex designated as the __root__.

> Root node

* parent of node
* sibling of node
* children of node
* edge
* external nodes, or leaves (i.e., nodes with no children).
* internal nodes.
* depth (level) of node (distance to root)
* tree height of tree
* degree of node (number of children)

Binary trees

### 2.2. Tree Traversal Algo

- postorder traversal
- inorder traversal  

Algo to search trees


## 3. List
