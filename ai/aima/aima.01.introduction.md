## `01.1` What is A.I.

| Dimensions of intelligence | __Behaviour__  | __Though__
| --- | :---: | :---:
| __Human__ | `01.1.1` Acting Humanly | `01.1.2` Thinking Humanly
| __Rational__ | `01.1.4` Acting Rationally | `01.1.3` Thinking Rationally

### `01.1.1` Acting Humanly

> the __Turing test__  
> the __total Turing test__  

### `01.1.2` Thinking Humanly

### `01.1.3` Thinking Rationally

> Logic + Probability

Can reasons but has limitation in term of acting.

### `01.1.4` Acting Rationally 

> __Agent__: Something that acts

> __Rational Agent__: An agent that acts so as to acheive the best outcome (optimal solution), or under uncertainty, the best expected outcome.

Effective behaviour. 
Act per per itself, autonomously
Perceive environment > Plan Actions > 
Adapt to new environments (= Learning to solve new problems)

> __Artificial Intelligence__: (as a study area). Study and construction of agents that __"do the right thing"__, according an objective. 

> __Standard Model__: 

> __limited rationality__: (~ vs __perfect rationality__) Acting rationally under limitation of data (uncertainty) and computation power.
